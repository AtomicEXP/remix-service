# wtv minisrv node.js

The ***wtv minisrv***, or "***hacktv_updsrv***" project is an ambitious node.js project to have a mini WebTV server that supports wtv-encryption for advanced level access.

This open source server is not yet ready for public use, but is available for anyone wanting to try to help advance it.
